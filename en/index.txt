Trade routes connected the island to distant lands, bringing wealth and knowledge. The Academy of Mystic Arts trained generations of powerful sorcerers, while the Order of the Crescent Shield defended the realm from any who would threaten its peace.","quote":"\"In those golden days, we believed nothing could break us.

Within months, nearly half the island was consumed by chaos.","quote":"\"When the King of Chaos smiled, even the bravest knights trembled.\"","p3":"All seemed lost.
